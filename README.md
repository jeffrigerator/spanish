# Spanish Verbs

This is (or rather, will be) a Spanish verb conjugator, written in Ruby.

The goal is to be able to correctly conjugate any Spanish infinitive verb.

Perhaps eventually it will also accept conjugated verbs, and return their
infinitive. I haven't looked into the issue in enough detail to know how
feasable this is, but it would be cool.
