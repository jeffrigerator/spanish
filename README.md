# Spanish

This library provides (or rather, will provide) some linguistic tools for
working with Spanish words.

Plans include:

* Syllabify any Spanish word.
* Correctly conjugate any Spanish infinitive verb.
* Given a conjugated verb, identify its conjugation and infinitive.
* Correctly return gender, pluralization and agreement for nouns.
